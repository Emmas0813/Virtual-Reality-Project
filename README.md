# Virtual-Reality-Project
Developed an educational VR game to demonstrate subsurface hydrogen production via gasification. It is cross platform and compatible on desktop with a list of instructions, or you can try it out on an oculus supported device.

This was completed for OU's UReCA summer fellowship and finished in the Fall 2023 during my Undergraduate Research Assistant position!

This repo contains the webGL build and the necessary files to locally host the game or, in my case, upload to Simmer.io to play.
Go here to play the game yourself! https://simmer.io/@EmmaS0813/subsurface-gasification
