# Virtual-Reality-Project
Developed an educational VR game to demonstrate subsurface hydrogen production via gasification. This was completed for OU's UReCA summer fellowship and finished in the Fall 2023 during my Undergraduate Research Assistant position!

This repo contains the webGL build and the necessary files to locally host the game or, in my case, upload to Simmer.io to play.
Go here to play the game yourself! https://simmer.io/@EmmaS0813/subsurface-gasification
